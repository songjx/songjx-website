  - text: In my senior year of high school, Jo-ann Fabric and Craft Stores held a nationwide prom dress sewing contest. First prize was $50,000. All materials had to be from Jo-ann. That was all. That year I was enrolled in an intro sewing class at school, so I thought I had a shot at winning.

  - text: I didn't win, of course, but I did make the final 20 of several thousand. This is what the dress looked like when submission time rolled around. It was in a much less complete state even on the day of prom, but at least by then I had succeeded at making a complete garment to wear that night, which seemed like a reach at the time.

  - text: As with all of these sorts of things, I started with a sketch. Having fallen in love with Marchesa dresses during my research, I decided to make a heavily embroidered symmetrical phoenix pattern straight down the front and wrapping to the back. I had no idea how long this would take, but I clearly overestimated the time I had.

  - text: I drafted the pattern out of an old sewing pattern design guide I had bought for this project. This is a basic torso pattern from which most other standard garment constructions can be made.

  - text: Pinning seam adjustments while the test pattern was on my body may not have been the best choice.

  - text: After a lot of fitting adjustments, I eventually arrived at what I had wanted all along - princess seams! Unfortunately, the stretch in the cotton muslin I used was not a great model for the fabric I used in the end, so the pattern I made turned out a bit too small in some areas.

  - text: To transfer my sketch pattern to the fabric, I tried a bit of thread tracing. It went okay. The tracing threads tended to get in my way; tailor's chalk fared no better. In the end, the most effective pattern transfer tool was an old pink marker.

  - text: I hand stitched the bird with a double strand of metallic gold thread; I used up at least one 1000m spool this way. Looking back, I most definitely should have found a more efficient way to make the effect I wanted.
