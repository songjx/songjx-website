  - text: 'Here''s a mini project I did for a class at Cooper called ME155: Design and Prototyping. It''s a prototype for an add-on to a standard home dimming light switch. The laser cut gear assembly mounts onto the D shaft of the dimmer switch, where the plastic knob would normally go. As you rotate the ring gear, the planet gears are driven, which in turn drive the sun gear, which turns the D shaft, adjusting the light level.'
  - text: The D shaft not only rotates, but also functions as a push button for on-off light control, so I cut a section from the sun gear to act as a button. The button is free to move axially, but it's keyed with a dowel so that it still rotates with the sun gear.

  - text: The gears are laser cut 1/4" Baltic birch plywood from Woodcraft; the fasteners are from McMaster; the light switch is from Home Depot. The gears are from SDP/SI; CAD drawings of them are available in Resources.
  - text: I prototyped the gears in museum board first to get a feel for their size and shape. I also considered painting fun space designs on the gears.

  - text: I normally stick to 2D for laser cutting projects, but Solidworks seemed appropriate here.

  - text: The light switch neatly mounts on the back panel. I'm not sure how you'd actually install it into a wall - I never got that far.
