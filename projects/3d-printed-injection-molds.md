  - text: My classmate and I wanted to investigate the possibility of 3D printing working injection mold prototypes on a deesktop 3D printer. We had access to a MakerBot replicator, a press mounted mini injection molding machine, and a larger cabinet style Stratasys printer. After a few iterations, we came up with a working procedure for making the molds. The accuracy and precision of the molds were limited, of course, by the printers themselves; the mold geometry also had to be kept simple. 

  - text: Here's the result of our most successful run. The gears are molded from polypropylene; you can still see the layered effect of the 3d printed surface as well as some sink marks halfway in from the outer diameter.

  - text: The mini injection molding machine was designed to be mounted into an existing drill press chuck. The machine includes a melt chamber and piston assembly and a heater controller. The heated mold sits in a vise under the nozzle of the melt chamber. Pictured is the sample aluminum injection mold that shipped with the machine.

  - text: We designed the part and mold in Solidworks, then 3D printed it in PLA. The nubs help align the mold halves, and the notches halfway down the short mold faces allow a flat screwdriver to be wedged in to separate the mold halves after injection. The molds are on a being heated hot plate just before molding, so that the injected plastic doesn't cool too quickly.

  - text: Here's a successful part. The injection gate needs to be removed manually, and the gear teeth need some refinement as well.
