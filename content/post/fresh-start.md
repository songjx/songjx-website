I'm finally working on this website again. I originally made it to use as a project portfolio for applying to internships. Now that I have a full-time job, I don't necessarily need to sell myself that way anymore, so I've shoved all the old projects to the bottom of the page and added blog functionality to the site. I'm also using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) instead of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) now. Hugo plays much nicer with Windows than Jekyll, and I find it slightly nicer to use. I plan to use this site mostly as a journal for crafting now, mostly for my own record but also in case it helps anyone who comes along looking to solve similar problems.
