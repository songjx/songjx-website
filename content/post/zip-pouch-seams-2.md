title: "Dealing with seams in zipper pouches, Part 2: eliminating side seams"
---

Last post was about my previous attempts at dealing with zipper ends, so here's my most recent one (the current favorite). No, it doesn't look that much different from the other ones, but you might notice that the ends of the zipper curve down into the seam a bit nicer. Please ignore all the creases...next time I'll back that floppy linen with some more robust interfacing.

Here's the good part. No side seam! The fabric is continuous around the side of the pouch, and the topstitching is uninterrupted. The zipper coils end gracefully, so when you pull the zipper closed there's a minimal gap.

Same effect on the other end: no side seam, continuous topstitching, and no gap. I'm really happy with this.

There's no hidden bulk inside, either.

And now, since I'm all about documentation, I'll describe how I did this.

Getting the continuous topstitching to work required thinking of the structure of the pouch more as a tube than a flat packet, kind of like knitting on circular needles rather than straight ones. That meant wrangling the zipper into as much as a round as possible. I started by tacking the coils together near the bottom stop. This is nominally a 7" zipper, by the way, which is my favorite size to buy when I don't have a plan but I want more zippers.

I separated the coils above the tack and folded each tape into a right angle, tacking just the inside corner to hold it there. Separating the coils is critical here, because it allows you to get the presser foot of the machine right on top of the coils at the end of the zipper. There'd be no way to do this otherwise. I forced them apart TSA-style, with a small pointy crochet hook I never use. No word yet on whether this damages the coils, but it seems ok to me.

At the top of the zipper I forced the last inch of coils to mesh together, then tacked them in a few spots. Meshing the coils by hand is a real pain. Next time maybe I'll remove the top zipper stops (the two metal crimps at the coil ends) so that only one tack is needed. Next, I did the same right angle folds in the tape.

Yes, the zipper is in kind of a weird, broken state right now. This is good.

I don't have photos of the fabric prep because I did it in a rush, but basically I cut one piece each of the shell and lining. The shell is a loosely woven linen and the lining is some cheap muslin I've had forever. The width was some arbitrary number that doesn't really matter (6"?), and the length was twice the distance between the zipper thread tacks, plus a generous ~2" of seam allowance for mistakes, turn of cloth, and the width of the zipper coils.

Next I started pinning the fabric to the zipper. I started halfway down one side and pinned around to the other. That initial halfway point is where the "eliminated" side seam ended up. If there were a way to temporarily remove the zipper pull and install it after all the sewing, I'd have done it. Since it was in the way, every sewing step after this had to be done in two stages.

I left an inch of room and machine basted down the pinned length. Next time I might not bother basting, since I don't think it really helped.

{{< large-image image="pouch08.jpg" >}}

The zipper pull had to move out of the way now. I wasn't sure if this would even work, since it's tricky to visualize, but inverting the lining through the zipper opening, then moving the zipper to the end of the opening, then turning the lining back to its original location did the trick.

{{< large-image image="pouch11.jpg" >}}
{{< large-image image="pouch21.jpg" >}}

After that I could machine baste around the rest of the zipper. After turning the thing right side out it started to make sense.

{{< large-image image="pouch13.jpg" >}}

I actually didn't baste the entire length of the seam, since I wanted to sew the back seams first on the shell and lining. Basting the whole lining would have prevented the top of the seam from fitting under the presser foot. It would have been nice to sew the back seams before installing the zipper, but that would result in little room for error in the length of the prepared zipper. Maybe there's a nice way to do that, though.

Once that was done I skipped pressing out of laziness and went ahead with the top seam. It was pretty satisfying to stitch right over the flat end of the zipper there, although I did it with the handwheel for fear of breaking the needle.

{{< large-image image="pouch16.jpg" >}}

Looking pretty good now.

{{< large-image image="pouch17.jpg" >}}

I did the topstitching in two sections, again because of the zipper pull being in the way. I think you could actually get the zipper pull past the needle and presser foot if you lifted the foot and pulled it under, but the bobbin thread would still be in the way.

{{< large-image image="pouch18.jpg" >}}

I have no photos of the bottom seam in progress, since it's not interesting. It's self-bound and protrudes into the space of the pouch a bit, but it's not noticeable.

That's all there is to it. I'm pretty happy with the result. Next time I'll consider prying or cutting off the zipper stops so they don't make a hard lump in the fabric. I'll also use a fusible interfacing on the shell and maybe a heavier lining, so it feels more substantial.
