title: Lined tubular pencil case
---

Here's a little pencil case I made for home, since I lost the one I've been using for years. It has a linen shell and muslin lining. Yes, I love lined pouches.

I wanted this to fit a good handful of writing and drawing tools. The longest implement I ever carry is a fresh 7" wooden pencil, so I sized it to fit one of those. The scale on the cutting mat is 1" square.

I sewed the lining and shell to one side of the zipper, then topstitched.

I sewed the other zipper seam next.

Inverting the shell reassured me that I didn't install the zipper the wrong way.

Topstitching the other side took some maneuvering.

I inverted the whole thing again and stitched the ends shut. Notice how on the left side, the shell and lining seams are misaligned by nearly a quarter of an inch. I tried this again later with a lightweight interfacing on the shell and it improved slightly, but I'm still looking for a better solution. Supposedly increasing the pressure foot pressure helps too, but it's not adjustable on my machine. I know I could also just pre-baste, but that makes more work and seems like a hack.

I trimmed the side seams and bound them with some homemade foldover tape. It's the same fabric as the lining, and I made it with one of those cute [Clover bias tape makers](http://www.clover-usa.com/en/bias-tape-bias-tape-makers/187-bias-tape-makers.html).

Folded and pressed in prep for taking in the corners.

The length of the corner seam is 1/4 of the finished circumference, so the end result is approximately a square. I eyeballed this at first, then used a ruler and got it a little more square. I thought about marking the corner seams on the fabric before doing any sewing, but I think that accumulated errors in the prior steps would make those markings unhelpful.

I also thought about trimming and binding the corner seams on top of the side seams. I decided against it when I realized how many fabric layers that would create at the intersection (16), and I didn't want to deal with that. The extra problem doesn't get in the way, anyhow. I kind of like how it hints at how the whole thing was constructed.

The finished product, full of goodies. I didn't bother pressing the side and corner seams.
