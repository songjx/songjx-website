title: "Dealing with seams in zipper pouches, Part 1: previous attempts"
---

I've been thinking about flat zippered pouches for a while. I'm not a fan of the usual zipper end treatments, which I think are bulky and take up too much of the usable zipper length. The bulk of four seam allowances (shell + lining) and the zipper ends is just hard to deal with in a way that doesn't make a hard lump at the top corners once they're sewn and turned. Covering the zipper ends with a separate small strip of fabric is all right, but that makes it hard to insert a rigid object that's nearly the width of the pouch, like a phone or book.

In the past I tried a few methods to get around this, but none of them were really satisfying. Below is an early attempt. It's entirely hand sewn, because at the time, I had the cheapest available Brother machine and avoided using it because I always struggled with bobbin jams.

The closed end is sewn into the allowances and turned, while the open ends are tacked to the lining.

I'm not sure what I was thinking with the blanket stitched seam allowances, but they definitely don't help with bulk. It's pretty much impossible to turn those corners neatly, which is obvious from the outside photos. I also don't like how the zipper tape ends are exposed inside the pouch, since they don't look nice and get stuck on the zipper pull. Still, despite all the things I don't like about this thing, I do use it every day to hold hair ties and other womanly artifacts.

Below is a more recent attempt. I use it to hold my sewing tools, which I use to make pouches, which end up holding other sewing tools...

This one has a much neater appearance from the side, which is nice. The fabrics are the same type: upholstery cotton shell, medium weight muslin lining.

This time I tried to be smart and tuck the zipper ends between the lining and the shell while the sides were still in two pieces. It looked great before I did the side seams, of course.

Everything went wrong after that. I don't remember the details, but I do remember staring at it for a long time trying to work out how to arrange the seam allowances, then struggling to get everything under the presser foot properly. That's why there's a huge gap between the zipper ends. All that bulk ended up betraying me when the top of the shell seam split. I ended up hand sewing that part just to hold it together. Oops.

Slightly better luck on the other end, but something still went wrong. The upper corners of the seam allowances are bunched up at the top of the seam. This one might have gone better if I had done a bound seam on the right side of the lining instead of trying to hide the seam. Maybe I'll try that another time.

That's all for now. Next time I'll describe a better solution I found.
