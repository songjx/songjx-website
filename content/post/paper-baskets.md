title: Baskets from waste paper
---

After living in one place for over a year, we've accumulated a bunch of video adaptor cables and other small dongles and dongle-like objects. Usually they end up scattered across the floor and stuck between couch cushions, so I decided to get a basket for them to live in. I didn't like any of the ones I found at Target, so I figured I could make one out of paper. This way I'd avoid buying another soulless plastinc *thing* or piece of overpriced lacquered wicker. I suppose I could have found something I really liked at a nicer home goods store, but that would mean spending even more money on something I'd feel obligated to keep around next time I moved houses. Paper from an old catalog is at least something that was destined for the recycle bin anyway, although now that it's a handmade thing, I might still find myself attached to it. Maybe the paper won't hold up to wear and tear long enough to be a contender for not getting thrown out next time I have a minimalist urge.

Finished product first, [/r/DIY](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/) style, to save you some scrolling up front.

This technique, by the way, is something I learned probably more than 10 years ago at some summer camp in New Jersey. I don't remember much about the place, except that I didn't make any friends, and it was an altogether neutral experience besides learning how to make baskets from old magazines and decorate them with crepe paper flowers.

I sacrificed an [80/20](https://8020.net/) catalog for this. I had originally ordered it because I thought I'd make some 80/20 furniture. That idea died when I priced out the cost of a basic couch frame and realized I'd be far better off sticking to dimensional lumber or even plain extruded aluminum shapes instead of trying to use 80/20. One day...

Anyway, I tore out the pages and rolled single sheets into tubes. The glue stick keeps them from unfurling. I rolled them tight at the start, like the coil of a lollipop stick.

I used a crochet hook to pre-curl the outside corners before rolling so that they were less likely to lift up after being glued.

I gave them a bit of a taper so I could daisy chain them into longer straws. The more overlap, the stronger the connection. I didn't want to use tape here.

I wanted a high aspect ratio on the basket opening, since I planned to put mostly odd, stubby HDMI adapter cables in it, so I started with a long rectangular base. The long straws are 3 units stuck together, while the cross-members are 2 long.

{{< large-image image="paper-basket03.jpg" >}}

The straws were pretty stiff, so I had to be aggressive about bending them into place. This was satisfying and not at all as difficult as I expected. Yes, I did this all while sitting on the living room floor. I wonder how many years I can keep doing this before my sore back just stops recovering.

{{< large-image image="paper-basket04.jpg" >}}

So, once I had a nice firm base, I started to weave the side walls. Trying to make all the straws cooperate for this step was a nightmare, and I struggled with it for maybe an hour before realizing I would need to change my strategy. Basically, the straws were far too stiff to be woven together one strand at a time. The base came out nice and tight because the 10 straws in a row all stabilized their neighbors, but all the free ends on the side walls made that impossible.

I all but gave up on the first attempt and started fresh. This time I wanted softer straws, so I ripped the pages down the middle before rolling them and rolled them much looser, so that they were hollow down their whole length.

Then I make some long straws again and started on a new base, this time a square in a herringbone pattern. This base went pretty well too. The softer straws were much easier on my fingers, which are actually still sore a day later. Then, when I started the side walls...I ran into the same problem. The straws were still nearly impossible to control, except this time it was more because they were too mushy. That, and they were still slippery, so I couldn't count on friction to hold the rows down in place. I ended up tying them down with cotton twine in a last-ditch effort to make them behave.

{{< large-image image="paper-basket08.jpg" >}}

I suppose I could have taken this attempt much further and gotten decent results, but some of the verticals were running out of length and I didn't want to bother with extending them. I also realized I wasn't really a fan of the flatness of the weave, and I wanted more of a round wicker effect than a flat reed one. Maybe I'll try this again some other day. I do really like how the herringbone looks.

{{< large-image image="paper-basket09.jpg" >}}

The main reason I ditched attempt #2 is that I wanted to try *combining* the stiff full-sheet straws with the softer half-sheet ones. So I unwound most of the failed side wall rows of attempt #1 and tried again with the softer straws. It worked! The softer straws were easy to bend around the stiff verticals without the verticals getting all bent out of shape like they were before. I did still end up using some string to help me get started, but after 2 or 3 rounds, the whole thing stabilized enough to stop the utter frustration of the previous attempt.

{{< large-image image="paper-basket05.jpg" >}}

Once I got to a good height, I started weaving down the verticals (which is probably not standard basket weaving jargon). Some of them turned out to have that super tightly rolled core right at the top edge, so they actually half-ruptured from the stress on the outside edge of the bend. Hopefully the broken ones won't completely fail too soon.

Well, there it is, fulfilling its intended use. Now maybe we'll stop losing our little stubby HDMI adaptors. I didn't trim the vertical too short, because I'm a little worried they'll pop out of the weave. I might end up hot gluing them and trimming them further so they're less like the deadly rear-facing barbs that are employed by all sorts of animals looking to do damage. The upper edge has a pretty obvious kidney bean shape to it, and there's not much to do about that now. Maybe next time I'll slip in a few strategic floral wires for a bit more control.

{{< large-image image="paper-basket11.jpg" >}}

Side view: the base of the thing also has an obvious waviness that I had a hard time correcting. That was partially a result of all the wrangling I did in attempt #1 to get the side walls started.

{{< large-image image="paper-basket12.jpg" >}}

Bottom view: still nice and tight. Those holes still might be big enough for a stray dongle to slip through, though. Maybe this thing needs a fabric liner.

{{< large-image image="paper-basket13.jpg" >}}

End view: I actually managed to get the verticals on the short ends of the base to fan out nicely in the end, even though they put up a fight.

{{< large-image image="paper-basket14.jpg" >}}

End view, inside: It doesn't look too bad from here, besides the leftover string. Moderate success!

Okay, that's all for tonight.
