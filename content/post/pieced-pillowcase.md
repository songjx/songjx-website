title: Pieced pillowcase
---

When we moved into our current place, we were pretty slow about getting living room furniture, so I thought I'd made some big floor pillows to sit on. I went with a pieced design because I love the look of patchwork quilts, but I'm not a fan of how stiff they are compared to the ultra-squishy fleece blankets I'm used to.

Here's the finished piece. The pillow is a 24 x 24" square down pillow from [fabric.com](https://www.fabric.com/), and the fabric is a "linen-look" blend from Jo-ann. I now wish I had gone for pure linen, since I struggled to avoid ugly press marks from the iron.

Below: side 1, initial design sketch. I wanted a 23" side length (-1" ease) to give the pillow an inflated look. Scaling the grid squares up to 1.5" resulted in a 23.3" side length, so I went with that.

I did my best to group the pieces in a way that would prevent errors from stacking up too much and avoid bulky 4-way seams. I thought I'd use a standard 1/4" seam, but the fabric ravels pretty easily, so I went with 3/8" instead. I did do a small experiment with fusible interfacing to prevent raveling, but that shrunk the fabric too much.

The dimensions in purple are with seam allowance added. I took the time to compute all the horizontal and vertical dimensions on the non-rectangular pieces, because I wanted to be able to cut all the pieces using a gridded cutting mat and straightedge, without resorting to paper templates.

I did a bit of geometry to get those numbers, rounded to the nearest 1/8". The nearest 1/16" would be better if the angled pieces were nearer to the center of the design, but in this case, it didn't matter so much.

Side 2 was a little simpler, besides some unavoidable 4-way seams.

Sewing took forever! I did save some time by using the chain piecing method, in which you don't cut the threads after finishing a seam -- you just feed the next seam and cut the threads all at once later.

I did a lot of sanity checks on the floor to make sure I was putting all the right pieces together.

Everything went together nicely. The contiguous red backgrounds disguise a lot of misalignment, especially in the long seams where I'd start with the fabric lined up and end with a good 1/4" of difference between top and bottom fabric. One day I'll sort that problem out.

Unfortunately, I don't have any photos of the zipper installation. I put in a 20" (I think) invisible zipper, which blends in with the red fabric.

Now, finally, here are all the designs I rejected before coming to the two I really liked.
