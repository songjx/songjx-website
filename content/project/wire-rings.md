Here are some brass finger rings I made for soldering practice. The wire is 20ga round brass from Monster Slayer; the solder is silver.
These are 3 separate stacking rings. Each was cut from a larger twisted and hammered wire pair. Getting this tight, even twist required the help of a pen or some straight tool as a twisting handle.

If I did this again, I'd try to find a way to make a tighter 3 (or more) strand braid.

Here's another loose twist.

This is what the rings looked like after soldering. I used a propane torch and paste flux for this.

The rings go into a pickling solution to remove the oxidation from soldering. This takes a few minutes if, like me, you don't have a heated pickle pot.

These joints were tricky to cut and align properly, as multiple loose ends needed joining. The final ring size was affected by the available cutting points, although I could have sized the rings a bit larger by hammering them out after soldering.
