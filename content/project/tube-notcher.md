  - text: 'For a year-long mechanical design course at Cooper, I have teamed up with four of my classmates to build an industrial tube notching machine. We will carry out all of the necessary engineering analysys to specify a safe, useful, and durable tube notcher to live in the school''s student machine shop. Deliverables will include the installed, working machine, a technical report including all analysis and design methodology, and service and maintenance documentation.'

  - text: 'The tube notching machine will be particularly useful in the construction of the school''s Formula SAE car frame, which consists mainly of welded round steel tube. Other students will find it helpful in their own framing and tubing applications. The machine will greatly reduce setup and machining time for precise angled and offset notches in various tube diameters, thicknesses, and materials.'

  - text: 'Instead of requiring a different hole saw for each notch diameter, this machine uses a single 1" diameter rough cutting end mill. The spindle drivetrain has an eccentric movement to move the end mill in a circular path with a radius of the operator''s choosing. Here''s a preliminary design for the machine:'

  - text: The isolated driveline design is pictured below. The drive consists of a spindle motor, a continuously variable transmission (CVT), and a hand-driven eccentric headstock spindle carrier.

  - text: 'I am in charge of the workpiece fixturing subsystem in particular. A modified milling vise will clamp the tube at the desired height using an integrated movable V-block. The vise will have a swivel base. The vise assembly will be mounted on a dovetail slide table, giving the piece two additional degrees of freedom. I''ve begun machining the dovetail cross slide components in house.'
