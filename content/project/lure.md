  - text: In 2012, I worked with Peter Ascoli to create a pair of kinetic sculptures for New York artist MaDora Frey. We worked with the artist from her initial concept through the aesthetics, materials, construction, and fabrication. One of the sculptures raises and lowers a glittery chunk of pyrite; the other grasps at it endlessly.

  - text: 'The controls are simple: an Arduino Uno and a BigEasy stepper driver control each of the stepper motors, one in each sculpture.'

  - text: In the feathered component, the feathers sit on linkages that center at a bent plasma cut aluminum hub. The hub rides on a lead screw driven by a stepper motor.
