The ice ring was a mini project for a course here at Cooper called Design and Prototyping; the objective was to make a two-part silicone mold for an interesting ice cube. I wrote a detailed tutorial for this project, which you can find on my Instructables page.

The effect is great while it lasts. The ring tends to become unrecognizable about a minute into its life in air at room temperature.

To make the mold, I needed a pattern. I chose to sculpt the pattern by hand rather than model it in 3D CAD and rapid prototype it, because my design was small and simple enough to make with hand tools. I also figured that I could achieve a good surface finish more easily.

I started with a sketch and some Super Sculpey, which is sold by the pound at fine art supply stores as well as craft stores.

The ring pattern was made in multiple stages to build up the geometry more easily.

Once I finished the pattern, I embedded it halfway in oil clay, built up an acrylic box around it, and made some aligning features.

Unfortunately, I don't have any photos of the silicone pouring process itself, given the messiness of the procedure and the relatively short working time of the two-part mixture.

After the first half of the silicone mold was poured and had cured, I could invert the box, remove the oil clay, and pour the second half.

The finished mold has a pour hole at the top face of the diamond.
