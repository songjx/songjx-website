  - text: I made these sushi pieces during one summer in high school. They're all made of polymer clay; I used mostly Premo brand polymer clay, with a bit of Kato for certain effects. I owe many of the techniques I used to books by Donna Kato.

  - text: I tried to make these pieces functional as jewelry pieces, to varying degrees of success; for a time, I even sold the jewelry on Etsy, the global handmade goods marketplace that was then small and now giant. Tutorials for the salmon and rice techniques can be found on my Instructables and deviantART pages.

  - text: These earrings somehow become the most popular of the series. They're also my favorite to wear.

  - text: Assembly of the salmon parts gets complicated, but having the right tools makes a much easier job of it. Pictured is a steel tissue blade, which was designed to surgically harvest tissue and has been appropriated by many clay artists for its long, thin edge.

  - text: Some of my designs were high on detail and low on wearability - the wearability was more of an afterthought (How can I convince people to buy these things from me?) My Etsy sales reflected this. I regret nothing. 

  - text: I rolled all of those little eggs by hand. The labor seems ludicrous looking back, but I had all the free time I wanted. It wasn't terrible compared to, say, hand knitting or embroidery, although most people avoid those activities for the same reason.

  - text: I created the patterns on the shrimp by scoring and smearing a thin sandwich of translucent and orange-tinted clay. I'm particularly fond of this one.
