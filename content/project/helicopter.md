I made Helicopter in my with a classmate for a course at Cooper called ECE150 Digial Logic Design, in my fist semester here. The course gives students a rundown in Boolean logic and breadboarding basic digital circuits using mostly CMOS logic components.

Gameplay and controls were taken straight from the classic Flash game, although we scaled down the graphical complexity slightly.

We were quite pleased with how the display turned out...
