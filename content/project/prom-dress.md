In my senior year of high school, Jo-ann Fabric and Craft Stores held a nationwide prom dress sewing contest. First prize was $50,000. All materials had to be from Jo-ann. That was all. That year I was enrolled in an intro sewing class at school, so I thought I had a shot at winning.

I didn't win, of course, but I did make the final 20 of several thousand. This is what the dress looked like when submission time rolled around. It was in a much less complete state even on the day of prom, but at least by then I had succeeded at making a complete garment to wear that night, which seemed like a reach at the time.

As with all of these sorts of things, I started with a sketch. Having fallen in love with Marchesa dresses during my research, I decided to make a heavily embroidered symmetrical phoenix pattern straight down the front and wrapping to the back. I had no idea how long this would take, but I clearly overestimated the time I had.

I drafted the pattern out of an old sewing pattern design guide I had bought for this project. This is a basic torso pattern from which most other standard garment constructions can be made.

Pinning seam adjustments while the test pattern was on my body may not have been the best choice.

After a lot of fitting adjustments, I eventually arrived at what I had wanted all along - princess seams! Unfortunately, the stretch in the cotton muslin I used was not a great model for the fabric I used in the end, so the pattern I made turned out a bit too small in some areas.

To transfer my sketch pattern to the fabric, I tried a bit of thread tracing. It went okay. The tracing threads tended to get in my way; tailor's chalk fared no better. In the end, the most effective pattern transfer tool was an old pink marker.

I hand stitched the bird with a double strand of metallic gold thread; I used up at least one 1000m spool this way. Looking back, I most definitely should have found a more efficient way to make the effect I wanted.
