My roommate and I have started a wonderful tradition of making rude cookies for Valentine's Day, just to lighten up the atmosphere a bit around school. We may decide to sell them beyond school for the coming season. Stay tuned.

The cookies themselves are nothing special, just standard rolled sugar cookies (mostly butter by weight), and the text is just an aerosol food coloring. The real magic is in the sentiment.
